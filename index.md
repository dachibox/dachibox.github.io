## Hi, I’m Dachi.

I’m a general engineer living in earth. I enjoy creating and managing projects that adds value to the society or company where I work. I value simplicity, honest feedback, and collaboration. Currently, working on [Nationale Nederlanden](https://twitter.com/NNSeguros) were we are building some awesome products.

In my spare time, I enjoy [learning](https://soydachi.com/blog), [organizing](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/CrossDevelopment-Madrid/?chapter_analytics_code=UA-77353604-1) talks / workshops and [contributing](https://github.com/soydachi).
